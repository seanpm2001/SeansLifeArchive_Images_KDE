# Start of script
# Project language file 4
# For: seanpm2001//SeansLifeArchive/Images/KDE/
# About:
# I chose CMake as the fourth project language file for this project (SeansLifeArchive/Images/KDE) as CMake is the #4 most used language by KDE for their projects, and I wanted to represent it here with a project language file, as this is a project directly about KDE. I will also make project language files for C++ (1) QML (2) Python (3) and Shell (5) It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
