// About:
// I chose QML as the second project language file for this project (SeansLifeArchive/Images/KDE) as QML is the #2 most used language by KDE for their projects, and I wanted to represent it here with a project language file, as this is a project directly about KDE. I will also make project language files for C++ (1) Python (3) CMake (4) and Shell (5) It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
