// I chose C++ as the first project language file for this project (SeansLifeArchive/Images/KDE) as C++ is the #1 most used language by KDE for their projects, and I wanted to represent it here with a project language file, as this is a project directly about KDE. I will also make project language files for QML (2) Python (3) CMake (4) and Shell (5) It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
